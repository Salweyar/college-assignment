        	<h4>Hello there! welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Salweyar Patel and this website will gave a tour about my academic  achievement.</h4>

        	<h6>Based on my previous academic education and work experience I have gained vast knowledge of project management and business analysis skills. I have always been curious about learning new technology and overcoming challenges through constant self-learning and improvements. My inclination towards project management started the day when I enrolled in the Business Technology Management program at Red River College where I learned the importance of communication, time management, and analytical problem-solving skills. One of the most essential aspects of my program is listening and understanding  the stakeholders problems and providing a suitable solution that will meet their needs. This program has benefited me to understand how to research and analyze business cases to make recommendations and forecast business profits and areas of need.</h6>

        	<h6> I have acquired technical skills that are highly detail-oriented, analytical, and accurate which permitted me to excel in agile project management. My strong interpersonal and communication skills allowed me to work with minimal supervision and provide quality reports and higher productivity while working at Market Force Information. These combined experiences have helped me understand many business processes required to improving the customer experience in this competitive business world. </h6>
